 What Is the JAVA_HOME Environment Variable?

The JAVA_HOME environment variable is a system variable that points to the location where the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your computer. The JDK is a software environment that allows Java-based applications to run on your computer without an issue.

Windows automatically sets the JAVA_HOME environment variable during the Java installation process. However, you will need to manually set it up if you have installed Java on your computer after the initial installation.

You can set up the JAVA_HOME environment variable using the below syntax:

JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk/installation
 

For instance, if Java is installed in the directory C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-20, then you would set the JAVA_HOME environment variable as follows:

JAVA_HOME= C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-20
